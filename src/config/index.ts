    description: `
      I'm a highly motivated engineering student specializing in Blockchain Protocol Engineering. My passion lies in diving deep into the tech stack to build robust, performant, and secure Web3 solutions. I have hands-on experience developing core infrastructure like a high-performance EVM data indexer in Rust, which taught me the importance of efficiency and data integrity.

      I thrive on complex challenges and am always eager to learn new technologies. From architecting DApps on Polygon to winning hackathons with innovative security tools, my goal is to contribute to building the foundational protocols that will power the future of the decentralized web.
